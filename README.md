# Image Colorization with RGB plates

The goal of this project is to colorize images taken by Prokudin-Gorskii a 100 years ago. The images are provided in the form of digitized glass plates that requires application of image processing techniques to produce a colored image.

This project is taken from [Dr. Alexei Efrosâ€™](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs194-26/fa20/hw/proj1/) class at the University of California, Berkeley. The output of the code on different images can be viewed in Final_Images folder.
